Basic intro to Github - helloworld
## Jolene 101
On most days I feel that there is not much to me, but at the same time quite a lot. I am good at a lot of things, but also seem to not be. I think that might be due to the fact that even though I might naturally have a lot of knowlege about a lot of things, I have not taken the time or put in the effort to master my "basic knowlege" and turn it into a pool of knowlege.  

**getting my ducks in a row**  In order to stop feeling like I am everywhere but nowhere, I have made the conscience choice to identify something I am good at and put in the effort to become *great at it* 

### In conclusion
I am working on myself, it is not easy, but it feels great. Nothing worth while comes easy, right?
